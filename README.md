# Touch-of-Good-News
Uses sentiment analysis APIs to rank and sort good news

Written with C#, PHP, and JS/jQuery

Currently hosted at http://touchofgoodnews.com/, but this will likely go down in the near future.

None of this is really very technically interesting. The C# half gathers good news and then calls a couple APIs and combines the ratings from the APIs into a result rating.

The PHP/HTML is a somewhat reddit styled page that displays the entries

The only piece of this that I would imagine is useful is the js for viewing articles by clicking on the arrow under the article. The page slides to the right and turns into a compact list, and most of the screen becomes an iframe that displays the article.
