# Touch-of-Good-News
Uses sentiment analysis APIs to rank and sort good news
Written with C#, PHP, and JS/jQuery

Currently hosted at http://touchofgoodnews.com/, but this will likely go down in the near future.
The C# half is pretty unremarkable, all it does is gather good news and then call a couple APIs and combine the ratings from the APIs into a result rating.
The PHP/HTML is a somewhat reddit styled page that displays the entries
The only piece of this that I could imagine someone else using is the js for viewing articles by clicking on the arrow under the article. The page slides to the right and turns into a compact list, and most of the screen becomes an iframe that displays the article.
